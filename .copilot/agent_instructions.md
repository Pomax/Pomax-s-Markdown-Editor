- Only ever use Opus 4.5 or newer. Do not use any other models.
- When VS Code spawns a new terminal, always run `cmd` first to force it back to the proper command prompt.
- Do not summarize your findings.
- Always generate unit tests and integration tests for new functionality.
- Always add API functions for any function the user may want to trigger, so that the same functionality can be triggered by third party agents.
- Always ensure that the documentation is up to date.
